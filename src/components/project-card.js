Provided your favorite songs, Explorify aims to recommend you other similar tracks (if there is sufficient information). But, the cool thing is - Spotify's API also allows you to customize your final matches with specific track attributes such as: danceability, energy, popularity, tempo, and more."

The premise of this application entails the idea to easily split the check when dining out with friends or family. Users can select the restaurant they choose and the menu for the respective restaurant will display. Each user will select the food they ordered and pass it along to the next person, and the total for each user will output."
